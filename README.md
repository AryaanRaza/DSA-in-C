⚠️ Status Note:
This repository contains my initial DSA practice in C.
Currently, it includes implementations focused mainly on **Dynamic Arrays**.
I am continuing comprehensive DSA practice in Java in a separate repository.


# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C 💻

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms practice in C**, implemented from scratch.  
The goal of this repository is to **strengthen problem-solving skills, understand core concepts deeply**, and maintain consistent practice.
